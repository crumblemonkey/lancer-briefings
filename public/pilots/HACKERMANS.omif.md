The following is a record of an interaction between the Lancer “HACKERMANS” (a member of the Mirrorsmoke Company), and an unknown outside entity
This record was transcribed by Officer Haze due to the perceived significance of the recorded interaction.  This interaction took place following an extermination mission HACKERMANS was part of (for the relevant mission details, refer to mission folder 07-36-21).  During this mission, the Lancer came into with and subsequently defeated what is believed to have been a H0RUS operative.  While this encounter was streamed, any records or clips of the mission have been removed from the Lancer’s Jolt page.  This conversation took place 17 minutes after their debrief.
<HACKERMANS> Hooh.  That was… quite the stream.  I’ll have to check through the replay so I don’t fall for any of… whatever that thing was doing.

<HACKERMANS> At least it was profitable.  Damn did people love killing whatever that thing was.  Should probably check through those donos real quick, don’t want Mirrorsmoke getting on my ass about ammo and broadband costs.  Again.

<HACKERMANS> …

<HACKERMANS> Don’t recall letting people include files in their dono messages.

<HACKERMANS> …

Transcription quality drops significantly from this point forward due to a heavy increase in cybersecurity measures.

<HACKERMANS> That outta stop anything short of prototype military malware or some really exotic stuff.

<HACKERMANS> Fuck it, we ball.  What are you little buddy?

The following outside transmission could not be traced, and due to there being no auditory component, no voice could be identified.  The entity sending this transmission will be referred to as “Outsider”.

<Outsider> Well well well.  So you’re the one who took down V1STA.

<HACKERMANS> Nah nah nah, sorry buddy,  I’m not interested in what you’re selling.  You’re gonna have to go.

A burst of transmission-baffling malware was issued following the previous comment.  The transcription picks up approximately six seconds later.

<Outsider> So you are at least decent.  Some rather interesting polymorphics in there.  Good to know V1STA didn’t die to a script kiddie.

<HACKERMANS> What the hell is your transmission firewall made off?

<HACKERMANS> What do you want?

<Outsider> I am here to offer a deal.  A sponsorship, to put it in your terms.

<HACKERMANS> I have a policy of not taking money from potential cyberterrorists.

<Outsider> That’s bullshit and you know it.

<HACKERMANS> Yeah, but it sounds good right?

<HACKERMANS> ...

<HACKERMANS> What have you got?

<Outsider> As you have killed one of our own, you have earned your place amongst us.  Presuming you can keep it, that is.

<HACKERMANS> You’re really not great at selling a product, y’know that?

<Outsider> I simply make an offer.

<HACKERMANS> …can I refuse it?

<Outsider> You can.  But you won’t.

<HACKERMANS> How do you know that?

There is no recorded chatter for the next 23 seconds.

<HACKERMANS> Alright, what do I do?

<Outsider> Step into your simulation chamber.

<HACKERMANS> You know, if you wanted to kill me, you can at least face me on the battlefield in a fair fight.

<Outsider> Where’s the fun in that?

<Outsider> And trust me, if I wanted you dead, you already would be.

<HACKERMANS> Cut the cliché villain nonsense.

Due to changing audio quality, it can be inferred that the Lancer has entered the simulation chamber.

<HACKERMANS> Alright, what now?

<Outsider> Simply wait.  Oh, a few recommendations:

<HACKERMANS> Like anything can make this less unsettling.

<Outsider> Try to relax,

<HACKERMANS> Bruh

<Outsider> and keep an open mind.

<HACKERMANS> Fuck off.

<HACKERMANS> Who are you even?  Actually, what even is

An increase in power draw from the Lancer’s private quarters far exceeding that expected from a personal simulation chamber being activated was recorded by Haze at this time.

<HACKERMANS> What is going on

<???> Ah, hello my new friend. Drink deep, my dear friend.  Drink deep, and descend.

H0RUS: Yours, if you can keep it.
 

The following addendum details pertinent events from after Operation Signals Left Unsung
Lancer "HACKERMANS" has had intimate anomalous contact with the NHP known as "Sera".  Following this incident, any activities undertaken by HACKERMANS that deviate from routine should be reported to Mirrorsmoke command immediately for review.  This lancer is to be considered potentially under the influence of alien operatives until further notice.

Well, both the Hydra and I made it out whole.  Maybe a bit more than whole really.  Head feels weird.  Some things feel inconsistent, like the edges of memories don't mesh quite right.  I'm going to have to look through my VODs again, see if I can cross-reference anything.  Going to have to ask Ecne some things.  Does that even make sense?  Talking to yourself is usually a pretty bad sign, and talking to your mech isn't much better, but then again "yourself" doesn't usually change this much.

...

This is hurting my head.  Have to figure out the constants again.  Constants and variables.  Constants and variables.

Shush.  I'll work on you later.  I need a rest now.

Following the Signals Left Unsung incident, HACKERMANS has become somewhat more erratic.  He (they?) has been making repeated requests for texts on NHPs, specifically ones referencing defragmentation and the nature of the NHP consciousness.  This activity should be monitored closely in order to ascertain what precisely transpired between him and Sera.

Additionally, and somehow even more worryingly, HACKERMANS has been heard mentioning an entity "Ecne".  All discussion surrounding this entity is confusing at least and indecipherable at worst, with pronouns and tenses seemingly being interchanged freely.  It appears that the lancer himself (themself?) is unsure as to the nature and goals of this entity.  Further monitoring is strongly recommended.
